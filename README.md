This application is created with organization in mind. The user is able to add and remove tasks that they need to do in the future. They can select specific dates and see what kind of tasks they have to do on that day. 

In order to run this you will have to go into the "CSCI2020U-Final-Project" directory and perform: gradle build, then gradle run, in your command line. The program will then run and you will be able to add/remove tasks from specific dates as well as view your tasks on a chosen date.
